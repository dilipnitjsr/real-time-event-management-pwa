Group 1: Frontend Development and User Experience :Progressive Web Application (PWA)

Title: "Design and Implementation of a Responsive Frontend for Real-Time Event Management PWA

Objectives:
1. Responsive Design:
   - Develop a responsive user interface (UI) that works seamlessly across different devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
   - Use modern UI frameworks like React.js or Vue.js to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.

2. User Interface Design:
   - Implement a clean and modern design that emphasizes ease of use, with intuitive navigation and accessibility features.
   - Incorporate visual feedback for user interactions (e.g., loading indicators, success/error messages).

3. Offline Functionality:
   - Use service workers to cache key assets and data, allowing the application to function offline.
   - Design the UI to handle offline scenarios gracefully, providing informative messages to users when they are offline.

Deliverables:
1. Responsive UI: A fully responsive interface compatible with various devices.
2. Offline Mode: A UI that supports offline functionality with service worker integration.
3. Frontend Documentation: Detailed documentation on the design, framework used, and user interactions.

Group 2: Backend Development and Database Integration**

Title: "Building a Scalable Backend and Database for Real-Time Event Management"

Objectives:
1. Backend Development:
   - Develop a backend service using Node.js with Express.js, or Django, to handle server-side logic, API endpoints, and business logic.
   - Implement RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend.

2. Database Design and Integration:
   - Design a scalable database schema using MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL) to store user data, event details, and real-time updates.
   - Integrate the database with the backend service to manage CRUD operations efficiently.

3. Real-Time Data Handling:
   - Implement real-time features such as live event updates, notifications, and chat using WebSockets or libraries like Socket.io.

Deliverables
1. Backend API: A robust backend service with RESTful APIs.
2. Database Integration: A well-structured and scalable database connected to the backend.
3. Real-Time Communication: Implementation of real-time updates and notifications.


Group 3: Security, Deployment, and Scalability

Title: "Ensuring Security, Deployment, and Scalability for a Progressive Web Application"

Objectives:
1. User Authentication and Security:
   - Implement secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0.
   - Protect sensitive data with encryption and ensure secure data transmission via HTTPS.

2. Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Deploy the PWA on a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure, ensuring it is scalable and reliable.
   - Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

3. Performance Optimization and Scalability:
   - Optimize the performance of the application by using techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, and caching strategies.
   - Ensure the application can handle increased traffic and data load by implementing horizontal scaling and load balancing.

Deliverables:
1. Secure Authentication: A secure user authentication system.
2. Deployed Application: A fully deployed and scalable PWA on a cloud platform.
3. Performance Reports: Documentation on performance optimization techniques and scalability measures.
