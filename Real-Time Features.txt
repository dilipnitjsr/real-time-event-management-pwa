Real-Time Features in the Project:

Live Event Updates:
  Description: Whenever thereâ€™s a change in event details (like time, venue, or status), the information is instantly updated on all users' screens.
  Example: If the event organizer reschedules the event, all attendees are immediately notified through the PWA without needing to refresh the page.

Real-Time Notifications:
  Description: Users receive instant notifications about event-related activities, such as reminders, new event creation, or updates.
  Example: If someone registers for an event or sends a message in an event chat, a notification is pushed to all relevant users in real-time.


Live Chat:
  Description: A chat feature allows users to communicate with each other in real-time during an event. Messages are instantly delivered and displayed.
  Example: During an event, attendees can ask questions or discuss topics, and their messages appear instantly in the chat interface.

Dynamic User Interactions:
  Description: The PWA reacts immediately to user actions without waiting for a page reload.
  Example: If a user likes or comments on an event, these actions are reflected instantly for all users viewing the event details.

Event Status Change:
    When the status of an event (e.g., from "Scheduled" to "Ongoing") changes, all users who are viewing the event page will see the update instantly without refreshing the page.

Attendee Registration:
    As soon as a new attendee registers for an event, the total number of attendees is updated in real-time across all user interfaces.

Q&A Sessions During an Event:
    During a live event, attendees can ask questions in real-time, and the presenter or other participants can respond immediately, with all users seeing the interaction as it happens.
